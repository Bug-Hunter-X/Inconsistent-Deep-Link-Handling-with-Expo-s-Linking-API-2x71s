This error occurs when using Expo's `Linking` API to handle deep links.  The `Linking.addEventListener` might not always fire or might fire inconsistently across different platforms and devices, especially if the app is not in the foreground or it was killed by the operating system. This can cause deep links to be missed or handled improperly. The following code demonstrates the problem: 

```javascript
import * as Linking from 'expo-linking';

Linking.addEventListener('url', (e) => {
  console.log('URL received:', e.url);
  // Handle the deep link here
});

Linking.getInitialURL().then(url => {
  if (url) {
    console.log('Initial URL:', url);
    // Handle the initial deep link
  }
});
```
